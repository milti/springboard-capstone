1. Get your API
import debot db = debot.DeBot('your_api_key') db.get_related_bots('election2016')
2. twitteR
3. Search for feeds
4. By the username of the bot
5. Then look for hashtags in those feeds
6. Now search twitteR again for those hashtags
7. This will give you a dataset which contains tweets from both bots and humans
8. So now we have a labeled dataset
which contains both bots and humans
this is the startpoint for training a machine learning algo
Thereafter we identify a suitable classification algo
