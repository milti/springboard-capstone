This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(tidyverse)
library(rpart.plot)


readRDS("capstone/dataset/shredCVL")

table(shredCVL$bot)

in_train <- createDataPartition(y = shredCVL$bot, p = .75, list = FALSE)
testing_set <- shredCVL[-in_train,]
training_set <- shredCVL[in_train,]

str(training_set)
table(testing_set$bot)
table(training_set$bot)
121/654
390/1964

# both ratios hold to an 20:80 proportion.


model <- rpart(formula = bot ~., data = shredCVL, method = "class")

str(model)
print(model)

formula <- bot ~ statusesCount + friendsCount + followersCount + listedCount + acct_age + langDiv + mean_time_betwn_tweets + Count + mCount

model <- rpart(formula, data = shredCVL, method = "class")

str(model)
print(model)

plotcp(model)

rpart.plot(model)

library(GGally)

ggpairs(training_set[,c(-1,-2,-7,-8,-12,-14)])


ggplot(filter(training_set, followersCount < 100), 
       aes(x = followersCount, fill = bot)) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(filter(training_set, followersCount < 100), 
       aes(x = followersCount, fill = bot)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_grid(bot ~.)

# how about the number of people they follow?
ggplot(training_set, aes(x = friendsCount, fill = bot)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(bot ~.)




```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
